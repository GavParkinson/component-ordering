# Angular Component Ordering

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.5.

## Purpose

The idea is to explore different ways of displaying ordered dynamic components in Angular.

The first way was to use flex ordering, passing in an object containing the order that components should be displayed in, then using that to set the flex order of the components.

The second way was to use ngComponentOutlet to display the components in an order set in an array.

These were both based on answers here: [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45280243/ordering-components-in-angular)
